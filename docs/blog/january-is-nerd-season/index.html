<h1>January is Nerd Season</h1>
<p>As noted in my prior post, I expected a busy time in January. It hasn&rsquo;t disappointed.</p>
<p><img src="https://c.tenor.com/myWhE0y5rTsAAAAC/brent-rambo-thumbs-up.gif" alt="So Far, So Good"></p>
<h2 id="i-got-married">I Got Married</h2>
<p>I had a lovely wedding &ndash; no seriously, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CY17ZM4vC59/">check it out</a>. Even with Omicron raging, we had a great turnout, and a greater time. It&rsquo;s not even been a week, but I&rsquo;m enjoying married life. Equally as enjoyable is being able to shift focus back to working on the house.</p>
<h2 id="this-old-house">This Old House</h2>
<p>January has been busy at the house as well. We got a radon fan, a new gas range, and recessed lighting in the bedroom. The next major projects are the basement floor and kitchen countertops. In the last few weeks, we* also mounted three TVs (no more exposed wires!), installed our new washer and dryer, and hung some shelving. Not to mention Christmas gifts of a standing desk (to me from Crystal), and a new huge tank (to Raf from Santa).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->* I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; but almost all of this was via our fantastic contractor.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="new-year-new-job">New Year, New Job</h2>
<p>I just finished my second week at Astute Communications, as their <strong>Lead Front-End Developer</strong>.</p>
<p>My first project is a <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/acf-5-8-introducing-acf-blocks-for-gutenberg/">Gutenberg+ACF</a> WordPress redesign, and I&rsquo;m loving it. It&rsquo;s hosted on <a href="https://wpengine.com/">WPEngine</a> so I&rsquo;m getting to leverage <a href="https://localwp.com/">Local</a> in a wicked streamlined way. Weirdly, towards the end of my last two jobs, I was angling in a direction that perfectly fits with my current project. At the first, I suggested we take a sharp turn into Gutenberg development, which wasn&rsquo;t fully prioritized. At the second, we were scoping (in excruciating detail) a broad redesign of a website leveraging Gutenberg as the engine. I&rsquo;m thriled to be in a position to be able to immediately execute, leveraging what I learned along the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s early, but I&rsquo;m loving the dynamic of my new role and setting. I have full confidence in the organization (and the full confidence of it), and am able to focus on execution. Far too often, I&rsquo;ve been dragged towards project management (not counting when it was my title) rather than the development side of things. If you&rsquo;re keeping up with my <a href="http://codepen.io/robpetrin">CodePen</a>, I&rsquo;ve begun accruing &ldquo;quick and dirty&rdquo; prototypes to scaffold layout development on my current project.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very thankful for this career move, and I look forward to work each day. I missed being excited about work, which hasn&rsquo;t been the case in at least the past year. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot everywhere, but am excited to be in a position to capitalize upon what I&rsquo;m learning without being bogged in red tape. <strong>More than anything, I&rsquo;m just nerding out here that I finally am getting paid to focus solely on the development side of things.</strong> It may run counter to <a href="https://petrin.dev">some of my long-term plans</a>, but this has already been such a supremely valuable experience in such a short time.</p>
