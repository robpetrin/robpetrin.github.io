                I&rsquo;m launching Petrin Development Services (PDS) in 2022. The plan is to use my skills, experiences, and expertise to help small businesses in my area to cultivate their marketing presence, and to help them manage all applicable web services that can help them grow their brand.
In the last few years, proper technical SEO hygiene has become more important than ever. And, in my humble opinion, it&rsquo;s becoming too treacherous of a landscape for small business owners to focus on while separately growing their businesses.

                A lot has been said about the run of New England sports teams since the turn of the century. While the teams have won many championships, the run of appearances in the final four (Conference/League Final) has been equally unprecedented. This project, a work in progress, looks to quantify that. Check it out on CodePen.

                Title Tally, hosted on CodePen, is near and dear to my heart. I was having a difficult time quantifying which cities had the most collective championships. I could to this per-franchise, but wanted to segment data to differentiate the Minneapolis Lakers from the Los Angeles Lakers, for example.
Originally written in Vue, I&rsquo;ll be working on a React version in 2022.

                Mat Stat is my most recent sports infographic project, and it is hosted on CodePen.
Like Title Tally, it looks to quantify championship victories using a number of metrics (time, location, etc.). Unlike Title Tally, this time it focuses on major professional wrestling promotions. The front-end is vanilla JavaScript. I haven&rsquo;t decided if the back-end will be dynamic (scraped from Wikipedia) or static (compiled in a local database) yet.

                Subject Matter Experts (SME) is perhaps the most important project listed here, and closest to my heart. I have a vision for re-imagining self-directed education, with a &ldquo;lesson&rdquo; as the primary increment for measuring understanding. Any subject can be broken down into the lessons it consists of, and I believe an entire educational platform (or a curriculum, or a doctrine) can be formatted comprised of lessons.
SME looks to implement that vision, as five primary applications &ndash; a lesson composer, a lesson repository, an assessment tool, a student dashboard, and a curriculum dashboard.
