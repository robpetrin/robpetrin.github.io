      <description>This a simple proof-of-concept for now, with limited functionality. It&amp;rsquo;s not actively being worked on, but can be found on CodePen. It deals cards correctly, but none of the underly game functionality is present yet. It uses the Deck of Cards API.</description>

      <description>This game is fully-functioning, and is hosted on CodePen. It uses the Open Trivia Database, which is a super easy API to work with, but the difficulty settings are a little wacky. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>This is a dumb little game I created in a couple of hours. Hosted on CodePen, it is exactly what you would expect.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s not much to see here. This little app, hosted on CodePen, is a fully-functioning Tic Tac Toe game. It can be played alone (but why?) or with a friend. A left-click (or tap) is X, and a right-click (or long tap) is O.</description>

      <description>This tool, first developed in 2018, is a proof of concept for a pictionary app I&amp;rsquo;d like to further develop. It is fully featured, but lacks any current practical application. The tool is currently hosted on CodePen.</description>
