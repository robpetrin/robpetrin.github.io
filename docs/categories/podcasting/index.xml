      <description>I had a lot of fun working on The Water Coolest. I first joined them as a the voice of their daily news podcast, which leaned on my recording and audio production skills. Additionally, I took on duties related to landing page development, and broader management of their entire marketing site. Subsequently, they were acquired by Barstool Sports.</description>

      <description>Homebody Media was a labor of love, as a number of colleagues were looking to develop a podcasting network. Built in Hugo, the requirements for integrating the site were both to foster content management and proper podcast RSS feed syntax. The theme was fully custom, and a joy to develop. HBM is currently on hiatus.</description>
