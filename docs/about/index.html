<p><strong>Technical Manager</strong>, <em>netamorphosis</em> (2021 - 2022)</p>
<p>As the founding <strong>Technical Manager</strong>, I learned the n e t a process, and where I could help it scale.

<p>As <strong>Digital Project Manager</strong>, I overhauled all internal development processes, while simultaneously balancing satellite team and freelancer management.

<p><strong>Founding Web Developer</strong>, <em>RoPurt, LLC</em> (2011-2013)</p>
<p>A friend and I joined forces to help local businesses develop a basic web presence. Primarily brochure sites, but also a niche for online ordering at pizza joints. A fun opportunity to get my feet wet in client management and web development at scale.</p>
