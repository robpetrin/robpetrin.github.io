As noted in my prior post, I expected a busy time in January. It hasn't disappointed.

## I Got Married

I had a lovely wedding -- no seriously, [check it out](https://www.instagram.com/p/CY17ZM4vC59/). Even with Omicron raging, we had a great turnout, and a greater time. It's not even been a week, but I'm enjoying married life. Equally as enjoyable is being able to shift focus back to working on the house.

## This Old House

January has been busy at the house as well. We got a radon fan, a new gas range, and recessed lighting in the bedroom. The next major projects are the basement floor and kitchen countertops. In the last few weeks, we* also mounted three TVs (no more exposed wires!), installed our new washer and dryer, and hung some shelving. Not to mention Christmas gifts of a standing desk (to me from Crystal), and a new huge tank (to Raf from Santa).

<sub>* I say "we" but almost all of this was via our fantastic contractor.</sub>

## New Year, New Job

I just finished my second week at Astute Communications, as their **Lead Front-End Developer**. 

My first project is a [Gutenberg+ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/acf-5-8-introducing-acf-blocks-for-gutenberg/) WordPress redesign, and I'm loving it. It's hosted on [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com/) so I'm getting to leverage [Local](https://localwp.com/) in a wicked streamlined way. Weirdly, towards the end of my last two jobs, I was angling in a direction that perfectly fits with my current project. At the first, I suggested we take a sharp turn into Gutenberg development, which wasn't fully prioritized. At the second, we were scoping (in excruciating detail) a broad redesign of a website leveraging Gutenberg as the engine. I'm thriled to be in a position to be able to immediately execute, leveraging what I learned along the way.

It's early, but I'm loving the dynamic of my new role and setting. I have full confidence in the organization (and the full confidence of it), and am able to focus on execution. Far too often, I've been dragged towards project management (not counting when it was my title) rather than the development side of things. If you're keeping up with my [CodePen](http://codepen.io/robpetrin), I've begun accruing "quick and dirty" prototypes to scaffold layout development on my current project.

I'm very thankful for this career move, and I look forward to work each day. I missed being excited about work, which hasn't been the case in at least the past year. I've learned a lot everywhere, but am excited to be in a position to capitalize upon what I'm learning without being bogged in red tape. **More than anything, I'm just nerding out here that I finally am getting paid to focus solely on the development side of things.** It may run counter to [some of my long-term plans](https://petrin.dev), but this has already been such a supremely valuable experience in such a short time.
