It’s been a while! I already fell out of my habit of writing at least one, and ideally two, blogs per month. I’ve certainly been busy, but that’s hardly any excuse.

Some of the things that have occurred, briefly, include —

* My wife started a new job! I’m still loving mine, and working on [finding my own clients](https://petrin.dev) separately. I have no aim to not work where I currently am, even though I do aspire to work for myself;
* After what felt like ten years of waiting, we finally received our wedding photos;
* We visited family in Florida last month, which was the first time we ended up boarding Buddy. He was a champ!;
* Speaking of -- I'm going to Nashville in August for work! I've never been, and am so excited;
* A close family friend just lost their house in an electrical fire. Thankfully, everyone is safe, including the pets;
* I've been keeping a close eye on the Celtics, who are currently in the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, tied 1-1. I'm out of the prediction business, and both games have been blowouts thus far -- so the series is still kind of taking shape;
* There was a new season of The Circle on Netflix released last month, which took a good deal of my attention;
* I'm having a pretty severe reaction to a medication I've been on for years. I'm switching it up starting next week, but on some days, it has made it hard to do much of anything during much of the day.

## Dad

[My father passed away](https://www.providencejournal.com/obituaries/ppvp0205962) on May 2nd, and his funeral was May 10th. He had been in poor health for the last few months, so this ending was expected. It was a rough final few weeks, a brutal final few days, but he died as peacefully as possible. I'm not sure that you ever quite get over losing a parent, and it's given me a lot of perspective on my time with them, the time I have remaining with our mom, and the life my father lived.

It's very weird making the binary transition from having a father to realizing I no longer do, a sentiment my two sisters have each also expressed. My mom mentioned that this next year or so will be her continuing to remember that dad is gone, which is the same thing we're all going through. It sucks, but I'm happy he's at peace after an arduous period of decline. For almost six months, my mom paused on her projects to devote care to my dad. As things continued to progress, my eldest sister stepped into a larger role, given her background in social work and healthcare.

As we begin the era after dad, things are going to be weird. We got together for Memorial Day without him, or mom, who was visiting her brother and sister-in-law in Florida. While my mom and dad were rocks for each of their children, they didn't have a ton in common. My father was a homebody, who spent most of his golden years watching game shows, reading the bible, and visiting the nearby beach. My mother was making up for time spent not traveling by seeing the world. She visited Europe a couple of years ago, and was set to go to Canada last month (a trip she canceled ultimately). My father wouldn't have gone on either of those trips, and was adamant in his disinterest in being a "snow bird" in Florida, which is one of my mother's goals.

Speaking of Florida, one of my sisters is set to move to Southwestern Florida as soon as her house is done being built. For now, we have a good deal of familial momentum we haven't had in probably the last twenty years. We're going to focus on family until my sister's big move, and try to keep family outings structured as best we can post-move.

I loved my dad. He weirdly became a huge Celtics fan in his final half-decade, and they've made a hell of a run for him in the playoffs this year. I hope they can close it out with Banner 18.

## Dev Projects

Internally, I finally launched [Title Tally](https://titlely.netlify.app/). Check out the blurb about it in [its portfolio post](https://petr.in/portfolio/title-tally/). I'm currently working on [Mat Stat](https://petr.in/portfolio/mat-stat/) a little, but mainly focusing on WordPress full-site editing after the release of WP 6 last month. More about that on the Petdev Blog, where I'm working on a comprehensive guide to the exciting possibilities and current realities.

Otherwise, I've been spending a lot of time on crash courses for Sass, PostCSS, and Figma -- working to better bridge the divide between my work as a front-end dev and aspiring designer. I've been using [Pixel Rocket](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn07jnZoflIMSdGWUkRqzsQ), who I super recommend.

Recreationally, I recommend you check about DALL-E 2, as I'm impatiently on the waiting list to try it out for myself. It's an AI platform that dynamically generates stock imagery based on text prompts. It's going to change the internet, and is a little scary. Don't just take my word for it -- [ColdFusion](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4QZ_LsYcvcq7qOsOhpAX4A) did a comprehensive dive into it, and how it works. [Check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1cF9QCu1rQ)!

## House Projects

I've added images to the bottom of this post. The next slew of house projects -- recent, current, and upcoming -- are as follows --

* **The Shed**: I finally got our shed under control, and have hung up hooks to hang many of the items taking up a lot of space. This includes yard tools (shovels, weed whacker, rakes, etc.), recreation stuff (two kayaks, two bikes, a paddleboard), and a few other items. It's nice to actually be able to walk in there, and to get to the snowblower/lawnmower;

* **The Yard**: Buddy deserves to be fenced-in, and we deserve to not have people periodically use our yard as a cut-through path. This one includes a number of sub-projects --
    * The fence, obviously. We plan to run along the entire back of the lot, connecting to each side-neighbor's fence. We then plan to fence in the patio, as well as the other side of the house to give Buddy some playing space;

    * We've designed our new deck, and are just collecting the materials to begin. The fence won't connect to the deck, which was the original plan before we decided to fence in the patio as well;

    * Before we can do a fence, we need to tame our back wall, which is primarily weeds, including poison ivy. It's going well, but is a huge project. We'll then need a land survey to confirm the fence can go where we'd like it to;

* **The Basement**: This is going to be a big one. In the family room, I've pulled down the ceiling, the "walls," and did a first pass at the floor. We need material hauled away, because the town doesn't want any of it. The plan down here is to --

    * Family Room: drop-ceiling with recessed lighting, open up the stairwell to give visibility into the room, install drywall and laminate flooring, paint, mount a TV, get a gigantic wrap-around couch, and spend the rest of our lives in this room;

    * Exercise Room: fix the electric, install recessed lighting, re-complete drywall, laminate flooring, mount a TV, buy a Bowflex, get swole af;

    * Storage Room: re-complete drywall, laminate flooring, buy a bunch of badly-needed additional shelves;

    * Downstairs Bathroom: to be continued.... probably in another year or two;

* **The Kitchen**: Unfortunately remains a low priority as long as everything in it remains ugly-as-sin-but-functional-for-now.

Hopefully, I talk <s>to</s> at you again soon!
