I really want the Bengals to win, and I expect they will.

It's nothing personal, Rams fans. I don't revel in your misery, and hold no ill will after two close matchups in Super Bowls 36 and 53. The Cincinnati Bengals fans have suffered far longer.

I'm happy Matthew Stafford is out of Detroit and can contend for a title. The Los Angeles Rams are equipped to go for it all this season with [future salary cap cramps](https://ramblinfan.com/2021/12/09/the-la-rams-have-already-spent-much-of-the-2022-nfl-salary-cap-increase/) preventing a multi-year run. Their coach looks forward to a [life after football](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33270237/los-angeles-rams-coach-sean-mcvay-ponders-future-says-wants-prioritize-family).

## Who's the next Superstar?

In my opinion, Joe Burrow is a superstar in the making. There's a void at the top of the league with Tom Brady's retirement. There's a lot of great young and up-and-coming talent at QB in the league -- Josh Allen, Mac Jones, Patrick Mahomes, Tua Tagovailoa, Lamar Jackson, Burrow, Lamar Jackson, Justin Herbert, Jalen Hurts, Kyler Murray. Of that list, only Mahomes has a championship.

## Rarified Air

If Burrow were to join that group (or Stafford for that matter). it would add another member to an exclusive group. With the retirements of Brady an Ben Roethlisberger, there are currently only three starting quarterbacks who have led their team to a Super Bowl -- Mahomes, Aaron Rodgers, and Russell Wilson.

## Why the Bengals?

The coronation of Stafford would be satisfying. OBJ getting a ring before Mayfield would be fine. Von Miller winning a second would be nice, and Aaron Donald winning his first would be better. But until Joe Burrow loses in the playoffs, I'm not picking against him in the playoffs. Cincinnati needs this more than Los Angeles.

I also believe it's the first Super Bowl, in the era of emojis, to feature both teams as default emojis. I predict üêÖ 24, üêè 20 in a mostly defensive struggle. The Bengals get a defensive or special teams score. Joe Burrow gets to the next level but the Rams do more than they did in their last Super Bowl.
