I expect this year to be a whirlwind, which is saying something compared to the prior few years.

First of all, **I'm getting married two weeks from today**. I couldn't be happier about that, but the late-stage planning is going to be my primary focus over the time between now and the big day. On top of that, **this week is my final at neta** and **next week I start my role at Astute**. I'm thrilled about the changes, but there's a lot of offboarding and onboarding coming up for me.

Once I'm feeling a bit settled from the above, there's no shortage of house projects to take back up. Most notably, we're remodeling the kitchen, adding a deck, adding a fence after the deck, and finally tackling the basement. Many appliances will be [future endeavored](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Future%20Endeavored), and we'll be in the market for lots of furniture and accessories.

Alongside house projects and day jobs, I'll be formally launching [Petrin Development Services](https://petrin.dev) this quarter. At first, we won't be fully open for business, as I juggle my other responsibilities. I'm very excited about this project, as I've been trending in that direction for the last few years. I see a lot of opportunity to help local businesses in my town and in the broader Boston Metro West area.

Finally, I'll be progressing a number of projects marked [work in progress](/categories/work-in-progress) on my personal portfolio. Some are simple applications I need to spruce up, while others are owed more functionality to better match my original ambition.
