I didn't watch *Fresh Prince of Bel-Air* growing up very much. I still super duper recommend the faithful-yet-gritty reboot.

This is not a paid Peacock promotion -- far from it. As part of [poorly predicting the Super Bowl](/blog/bengals-will-win/), I picked up the streaming service for a month. I was innundated for hours with commercials for Bel-Air, and decided to check it out.

I wasn't the hugest fan of the original Fresh Prince show, but I was familiar enough to note the nods to the sitcom. If you haven't seen the show, there's actually quite a bit of diverging from the source material -- beyond the realistic racial overtones which were largely absent from the original.

The casting is spot-on, and the acting is great. Every episode is uncomfortable to watch, because of investment we already have in the characters (and the shit they're constantly getting into). I've watched three episodes in three days -- I'm trying to pace myself -- and I can't stop thinking about it. There's ten total episodes this season.

It's gotten **okay** reviews thus far, so maybe it's just me. But I don't often go out of my way to recommend shows. So check it out, will ya?

**PS:** Even though I'm paying for Peacock, they're still showing ads. What do you think this is, basic cable? Hulu gets a lot of flack but at least they pull the ads when you pay.
