I'm launching [Petrin Development Services](https://petrin.dev) (PDS) in 2022. The plan is to use my skills, experiences, and expertise to help small businesses in my area to cultivate their marketing presence, and to help them manage all applicable web services that can help them grow their brand.

In the last few years, proper technical SEO hygiene has become more important than ever. And, in my humble opinion, it's becoming too treacherous of a landscape for small business owners to focus on while separately growing their businesses. It's very easy to do SEO wrong, which is why I've chosen to specialize in it -- alongside my traditional focuses of branding, web design, development, and (simplified and affordable) hosting.

This is my primary project in 2022, and hopefully it becomes even more of my primary focus as I get it off the ground over the next year (or three).
