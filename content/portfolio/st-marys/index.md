Unfortunately, St. Mary's is now closed. I took over development of the site in 2014, which badly needed a re-theme. It is based on WordPress, and uses a boilerplate theme. This project was more of an exercise in content than functionality, as the site's primary purpose was transmitting information.

This was one of my earlier forays into graphic design, as I implemented the global hero banner, and the Crimson Eagle logo. Both can be viewed in the full-page screenshot below.
