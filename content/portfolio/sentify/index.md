I worked on the current iteration of the [Sentify](https://sentify.co/) website in early 2020. This was strictly a development engagement, as a number of their services overlap with what I offer as part of [Petrin Development Services](/portfolio/petrin-dot-dev). But it was a fun little website I enjoyed contributing to, and perhaps may continue to contribute to in the future.
