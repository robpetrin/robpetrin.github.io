Mat Stat is my most recent sports infographic project, and it is hosted on [CodePen](https://cdpn.io/robpetrin/debug/vYmJVdz). 

Like [Title Tally](/portfolio/title-tally), it looks to quantify championship victories using a number of metrics (time, location, etc.). Unlike Title Tally, this time it focuses on major professional wrestling promotions. The front-end is vanilla JavaScript. I haven't decided if the back-end will be dynamic (scraped from Wikipedia) or static (compiled in a local database) yet.
