Subject Matter Experts (SME) is perhaps the most important project listed here, and closest to my heart. I have a vision for re-imagining self-directed education, with a "lesson" as the primary increment for measuring understanding. Any subject can be broken down into the lessons it consists of, and I believe an entire educational platform (or a curriculum, or a doctrine) can be formatted comprised of lessons.

SME looks to implement that vision, as five primary applications -- a lesson composer, a lesson repository, an assessment tool, a student dashboard, and a curriculum dashboard. This will take me years to fully realize, but the vision is clear in my head. The front-end concept is currently hosted on [CodePen](https://cdpn.io/robpetrin/debug/qBjOzoR).
