My work on the VAASL website was challenging. There were rigid design requirements within their existing design system, as the site was a pioneer in accessibility. This hindered innovation, but resulted in a clean site -- though admittedly the theme we were working in was very dated (even for 2015). The site has had a subsequent redesign in the intervening years, after my involvement ended.
