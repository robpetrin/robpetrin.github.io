Homebody Media was a labor of love, as a number of colleagues were looking to develop a podcasting network. Built in Hugo, the requirements for integrating the site were both to foster content management and proper podcast RSS feed syntax. The theme was fully custom, and a joy to develop. HBM is currently on hiatus.
