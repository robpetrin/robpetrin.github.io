This a simple proof-of-concept for now, with limited functionality. It's not actively being worked on, but can be found on [CodePen](https://cdpn.io/robpetrin/debug/wvKVZEE). It deals cards correctly, but none of the underly game functionality is present yet. It uses the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com).
