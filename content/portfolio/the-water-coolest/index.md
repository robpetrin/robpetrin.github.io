I had a lot of fun working on The Water Coolest. I first joined them as a [the voice of their daily news podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-water-coolest/id1286317515), which leaned on my recording and audio production skills. Additionally, I took on duties related to landing page development, and broader management of their entire marketing site. Subsequently, they were acquired by [Barstool Sports](https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/21/12/24717252/barstool-sports-acquires-business-and-market-newsletter-the-water-coolest).
